=============== 

This app was created using React and Redux for the front end and Node.js and Express for the back end.

## Running the app in regular way

Navigate to each directory (./frontend & ./server) of the project and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn install
yarn dev
# or
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This will start the front-end, back-end.



# Thank you for your time and consideration!
